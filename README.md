# RelationalGPT

## How to run it


```bash
devbox shell
pytest
```

[Check this test](/tests/test_conditions.py) to see how to use it. However, 
the intent is to have ChatGPT or DeepSeek to generate the DSL code after a chat with a user.
The DSL is supposed to run a web app with Flask etc... but it is not implemented at the moment.
